    "The first version of Python released in 1991—earlier than the programming language Java. For much of its early existence, Python remained a niche language and did not gain widespread popularity. However, in recent years, the rise and proliferation of big data and artificial intelligence technologies have significantly boosted Python’s popularity. Thanks to its **simplicity and strong scalability**, Python aligns well with the needs of these emerging technologies, allowing it to surpass many other programming languages and rise rapidly in prominence."
